Create a React (TypeScript) component for “Planning Mode” in our trip‑planner app. It must display a horizontal, scrollable, linear timeline where any team member can click an “Add Event” button to insert a new node:

**Layout & Interaction**  
- Full‑width, horizontal timeline with snap‑to‑grid behavior.  
- Evenly spaced circular event nodes (48 px diameter) on a single baseline.  
- Off‑screen nodes hinted via a 20% opacity gradient fade at left/right edges.  
- “Add Event” button floating above the timeline at the center; on click, show a modal to enter “Event Title” and “Optional Time” fields.  
- New events inserted inline at the appropriate scroll position.

**Styling & Aesthetic**  
- Bubbly, playful UI: pastel gradients for nodes, soft drop‑shadows, and rounded corners on all controls.  
- Tailwind CSS for utility classes; maintain consistent spacing (p-4, m-2) and typography (font-medium, text-base).  
- Nodes: background `bg-gradient-to-br` from pastel blue to pastel green, white text, 2 px border, full rounding.  
- “Add Event” button: circular, 56 px, pastel pink gradient, pulsing micro‑animation on hover.

**Component Requirements**  
- Expose props:  
  • `events: Array<{ id: string; title: string; time?: string }>`  
  • `onAdd(event: { title: string; time?: string }): void`  
- Use React hooks for state and scroll position; include stub for real‑time integration (e.g. WebSocket or Firebase).  
- Include Modal component for event creation, with proper form validation and focus trap.

**Deliverables**  
- `TimelinePlanningMode.tsx` with JSX, Tailwind classes, stubbed data flow.  
- Basic CSS animations (scroll snap, button pulse).  
- Comments marking where to integrate real‑time updates and backend calls.

Focus on a clean code structure, reusable pieces, and a bubbly, addictive UX.

Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are to:

Enable Collaborative Trip Planning: Create a tool that allows a group of 7 friends to collaboratively plan their NYC trip itinerary in real-time.
Provide an Interactive Timeline UI: Offer a visually appealing and intuitive timeline interface where users can add, view, and interact with events seamlessly.
Ensure a Satisfying User Experience: Design a UI that is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, making the planning process enjoyable and engaging for the group.
Core Functionality
To achieve these goals, the app will include the following key features:

Real-Time Interactive Timeline:
A horizontal timeline displaying events in chronological order.
Users can add events with details such as time, location, and description.
Real-time updates ensure all group members see changes instantly as events are added or edited.
Event Addition and Suggestions:
A simple, intuitive interface (e.g., a form or modal) for adding new events to the timeline.
(Optional but recommended) A feature allowing users to suggest events, with the ability for others to vote or comment, aiding group decision-making.
UI Design and Aesthetics:
A playful, satisfying design with rounded shapes, pastel colors, and smooth animations.
Emphasis on ease of use, ensuring event management feels intuitive and visually enjoyable.
Scalability and Simplicity:
The initial version will focus on the core timeline and event addition features for a smooth launch.
Future enhancements (e.g., mapping locations or estimating travel times) can be added later as needed.
